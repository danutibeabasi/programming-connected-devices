In this lab you will learn to flash and program your ESP32 microcontroller with micropython.

== Introduction to the Adafruit HUZZAH32 - ESP32 Feather

ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32[(Wiki)].

The main microcontroller we use is a link:docs/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather.pdf[FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32], that contains the link:docs/espressif-esp-wroom-32.pdf[Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32 module], a generic Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + Bluetooth Low Energy microcontroller unit. At its core, the ESP32-WROOM-32 module uses the link:docs/espressif-esp32.pdf[ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip].

== Flash MicroPython on the ESP32

link:https://micropython.org/[MicroPython] is a full Python compiler and runtime that is optimized to run on microcontrollers. One can use an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately, or upload a set of python files to the microcontroller.

In this lab we will flash the micropython firmware on the ESP32, then use the Pymakr extension for link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code].

Follow the MicroPython tutorial link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html#esp32-intro[Getting started with MicroPython on the ESP32], and keep in mind the notes below.

NOTE: the "port" setting is `COM*` on Windows, `/dev/ttyS*` on Linux, `/dev/cu.*` on macOS (where * means "something"). Follow link:https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#check-port-on-windows[this guide for Windows] or link:https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html#check-port-on-linux-and-macos[this guide for Linux and macOS] to find what port the FeatherBoard Adafruit HUZZAH32 is using.

NOTE: Windows users. If you don't see the COM port for your device, it may mean that the CP2104 USB to UART Bridge controller pilots are not installed. You can install link:https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers[download them] and install them manually from the Device Manager.

NOTE: Windows users, you may use the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1 (WSL1) to run commands. If your "port" setting is `COM5` on windows, then it becomes `/dev/ttyS5` on WSL1. Make sure your distribution uses WSL1 (not WSL2). If not, you can either convert an existing WSL2 distribution to WSL1, or install a fresh WSL1 distribution. Find tutorials online. 

WARNING: Linux users: must belong to groups `dialout` and `tty` to access the board.

== Open the interactive prompt (the REPL)

Once the MicroPython firmware is flashed on the device, you can install the Pymakr extension for link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code].


1. Make sure you have link:https://code.visualstudio.com/Download[Visual Studio Code] installed 
2. PyMakr require an installation of node.js on your machine. Make sure you can run command `node`.
3. Make sure you have the following extensions installed: link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-extension-pack[Python Extension Pack], link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance[Pylance], link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pycom.Pymakr[Pymakr].

In the Pymakr extension tab, you should find your device under `DEVICES`. Click on "Connect Device" (ðŸ—² button), then on "Create a Terminal". 

That's it, you opened a REPL on the ESP32! Let's play a bit with it.

. Create a timer to turn on and off the LED on GPIO#13 every 500ms.

    
. Find a way to turn on and off the LED on GPIO#13 every 500ms, and the LED on GPIO#27 every 300ms.
    
    
. As the ESP32 has only four hardware timers (other microcontrollers usually have less), it wouldn't be possible to generalize the solution of exercise 4 to _n_ LEDs. Develop a solution that uses the link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/uasyncio.html[`uasyncio` module for asynchronous I/O scheduling]

. Print the current date and time on the screen, update every second.
. When button A is pressed, invert the colours. 
. Also print a counter that increments when button B is pressed (use an interrupt)
. The source of the `framebuf.FrameBuffer` class that `SSD1306` inherits from, and its methods, is actually defined in a C file in the link:https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/extmod[`extmod` folder] of the MicroPython repository (see link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/develop/gettingstarted.html?highlight=extmod#folder-structure[description here]). 
.. Find the file + line where the constructor is defined
.. Find the file + line where the `text` method is defined
. In this file, we see that the `framebuf.FrameBuffer.text()` method uses the `font_petme128_8x8` object at line 794, which stores the pixel array for each ascii character and is defined in a library that is included at line 35.
.. Describe how each character is defined as bits and bytes.
.. Choose a little monster in the image below, and write what would be the 8 bytes to display this monster.
. Using your answer to question 8b, print one of the monsters below on the screen.
